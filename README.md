# https://plus.maths.org/content/mysterious-number-6174
# Kaprekar's operation.
# There are four unit digit numbers (from 0 to 9), which can not be all the same, not 1111, 2222....
# Then rearrange the digits to get the largest and smallest numbers these digits can make.
# Finally, subtract the smallest number from the largest to get a new number,
# and carry on repeating the operation for each new number.
# When we reach 6174 the operation repeats itself, returning 6174 every time.
